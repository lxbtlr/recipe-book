## Ingredients
- 16 large shrimp, peeled
- black pepper, to taste
- 2 tsp oyster sauce
- ¼ tsp fish sauce
- 2 cloves garlic, grated
- ⅛ tsp garlic powder
- 2 tsp hot chili oil (optional if you prefer not spicy)
- 1 avocado, thinly sliced
- 8 sheets rice paper, cut in halves
- oil for pan-frying
### Sauce
- 3 tbsp thai sweet chili sauce
- 1 tbsp kewpie mayo

## Instructions
1. Rinse the shrimp and pat dry.  Transfer to a bowl and season with black pepper, oyster sauce. fish sauce, grated ginger, garlic powder and hot chili oil, if using.  The brand I used is Lao Gan Ma which I’ve linked in the notes below.
2. Prepare a large bowl of slightly warm water for dipping and cut each rice paper in half.  Dip the rice paper in water and rotate around twice, then place on a cutting board.  I usually like to dip two at a time for wrapping.  Depending on the temperature of your water, you’ll need to wait until it softens (about 20 seconds).
3. Place an avocado in the middle of the rice paper and a shrimp on top.  Fold the large sides over the shrimp, then flip it over (so the avocado faces the top) and repeat with the remaining sides.
4. Add a drizzle of oil in a nonstick pan over medium-high heat and add the rice paper, shrimp side down.  Cook about 1.5 minutes, then flip it over and cook for 30 seconds.  Note these times are approximate and will vary depending on the size of your shrimp and heat level.
5. Let it cool on a rack and pair with creamy thai sweet chili sauce.  Serve immediately and enjoy!
