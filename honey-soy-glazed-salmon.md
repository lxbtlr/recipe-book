## Ingredients
- 3 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce
- 2 tbsp honey
- 3 garlic cloves (15g)
- 1 tbsp sambal oleok (fresh chili paste)
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- oil for pan-frying
- 2 salmon filets, skin-on (½ lb or 227g each)
- salt & pepper to taste
- chopped scallions and lime for garnish

## Instructions
1. Remove the salmon from the fridge to take the chill off.  Prepare the sauce mixture and set aside for later.
2. Heat a nonstick pan on medium-high and add a tablespoon of oil.
3. Pat dry the salmon to remove moisture, then season liberally with salt and pepper.  Add the salmon to the pan, skin-side down, and cook undisturbed for about 4 minutes, depending on the size of your salmon.  The skin protects it from becoming dry, so you want to cook it the majority of the way on this side.  The sides of the salmon will begin to turn white and creep upwards, which is a signal of it being ready to be flipped.
4. Flip and sear the salmon to the other side, then remove from the pan.  There’s lots of flavor leftover in the pan, so add your vegetables of choice for a quick stir-fry.
5. With the now “clean” pan, reduce the heat to medium and add the sauce mixture.  Cook until reduced by about halfway, then add back the salmon and cook until it reaches your desired doneness.  Serve with steamed white rice & enjoy!
