## Pasta with Herbed Spam and White Bean Sauce
Serves 2-4. Extremely filling.
### Ingredients
- 1/3 lb pasta
- 1/2 can Spam
    - You could probably substitute ~8 slices of bacon.
- 1 can beans
    - I used butter beans. Any large bean that has a high bean:skin ratio works.
- 2 cups chicken stock
    - You probably won't use all of it.
- 4-6 cloves of garlic, to taste
- 1 portion dried rubbed sage
- 1 portion dried parsley flakes
- 1/2 portion dried oregano
- 1/3 portion red pepper flakes
- salt
- freshly ground black pepper
- olive oil

### Procedure
#### Prep
- Cut the spam into small chunks, ranging from 1/4 to 2/3 of an inch on a side.
- Finely chop the garlic.
- Open and drain your can of beans.
- Continuously taste and season with salt and pepper.
